# Agile project management

## AGILE
Agile management, or agile process management, or simply agile refer to an iterative, incremental method of managing the design and build activities for engineering, information technology, and other business areas that aims to provide new product or service development in a highly flexible and interactive manner; an example is its application in Scrum, an original form of agile software development.[1] It requires capable individuals from the relevant business, openness to consistent customer input, and management openness to non-hierarchical forms of leadership.[citation needed] Agile can in fact be viewed as a broadening and generalization of the principles of the earlier successful array of Scrum concepts and techniques to more diverse business activities. Agile also traces its evolution to a "consensus event", the publication of the "Agile manifesto", and it has conceptual links to lean techniques, kanban (かんばん(看板)?), and the Six Sigma area of business ideas.[1]

“We loved Redmine, but needed integrated Agile tools since we are a three-location, three-timezone team. The combination of JIRA Software beat Redmine+Various-Agile-Plugins. We also wanted to start doing code reviews, so having Crucible integrated provided additional justification to make the switch.”
